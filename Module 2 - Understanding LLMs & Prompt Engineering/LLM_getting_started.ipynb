        "### How Large Language Models Work\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems that understand and generate human-like text. They use transformer architectures, which are neural networks designed to process sequences like sentences. These models are trained on massive datasets, learning to predict the next word based on previous ones, which helps them grasp grammar, syntax, and meaning. For example, models like GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters, can handle diverse tasks due to their scale and training on vast text from books and websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basics of Prompt Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering involves designing inputs to guide LLMs to produce desired outputs. It’s crucial because the way you phrase a prompt can significantly affect the response. Techniques include:\n",
        "- **Zero-Shot Learning**: Asking the LLM to perform a task without examples, like classifying text as positive or negative.\n",
        "- **Few-Shot Learning**: Providing a few examples, such as input-output pairs, to help the model adapt to new tasks.\n",
        "- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning, like breaking down a math problem into smaller steps before answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods make LLMs versatile for tasks like question answering or text generation, depending on how you prompt them.\n",

        "### Survey Note: Detailed Exploration of LLMs and Prompt Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "This section provides a comprehensive analysis of how Large Language Models (LLMs) function and the intricacies of prompt engineering, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques. The discussion is informed by recent research and aims to offer a detailed understanding for those interested in the technical and practical aspects of these AI systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Understanding Large Language Models\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs are advanced AI systems designed to comprehend and generate human-like text, leveraging deep learning techniques. They are primarily built on transformer architectures, which were introduced as a breakthrough in neural network design for processing sequential data. The transformer model, as described in various sources, includes an encoder and a decoder, with a key feature being the self-attention mechanism. This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence, enabling it to capture contextual relationships effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "The training process of LLMs is extensive, involving unsupervised learning on vast datasets. These datasets, often comprising billions of words from diverse sources such as books, articles, and websites, enable the model to predict the next word in a sequence. This predictive capability, rooted in autoregressive training, allows LLMs to understand basic grammar, syntax, and even semantic nuances. For instance, [AWS: What is LLM?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/) highlights that LLMs can consider billions of parameters, with models like GPT-3 having 175 billion parameters, as noted in [Wikipedia: Large Language Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model/).\n",
        "\n",
        "The scale of these models is a critical factor in their performance. Larger models, with trillions of parameters in cases like GPT-4, exhibit \"emerging abilities,\" meaning they can perform tasks they weren't explicitly trained for, such as reasoning or solving problems in new domains. This is attributed to their exposure to diverse data during pre-training, as discussed in [Medium: How Large Language Models Work](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/how-large-language-models-work-91c362f5b78f).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The Role of Prompt Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts to guide LLMs in generating desired outputs. Given the sensitivity of LLMs to input phrasing, prompt engineering is essential for bridging human intent and machine understanding. It involves designing inputs that specify tasks, provide context, and steer the model toward accurate and relevant responses. This discipline has gained prominence with the rise of models like ChatGPT, as noted in [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/), which emphasizes its importance for both researchers and developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process involves trial and error, creativity, and an understanding of the model's capabilities. For example, [Google Developers: Prompt Engineering for Generative AI](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/resources/prompt-eng) suggests structuring prompts by defining roles, providing context, and giving clear instructions. This approach ensures the LLM interprets the task correctly, avoiding nonsensical outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Zero-Shot Learning: Performing Without Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "Zero-shot learning refers to the ability of LLMs to perform tasks they haven't been explicitly trained on, without any examples provided. This capability stems from their pre-training on vast and diverse datasets, which equips them with a broad understanding of language and context. As described in [Hugging Face: Zero-Shot Classification](https://huggingface.co/tasks/zero-shot-classification/), zero-shot learning is an instance of transfer learning, where the model leverages auxiliary information to associate observed and non-observed classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, an LLM might be asked to classify text into categories it hasn't seen before, such as identifying sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) without prior examples. This is possible because the model, through its training, understands concepts like sentiment from the data it was exposed to. [Prompt Engineering Guide: Zero-Shot Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/zeroshot) notes that instruction tuning enhances zero-shot capabilities, making it effective for tasks where labeled data is scarce. However, limitations exist for highly specific or complex tasks requiring deep domain knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Few-Shot Learning: Adapting with Minimal Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "Few-shot learning allows LLMs to adapt to new tasks with only a few examples, reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where data is limited but some examples can be provided to demonstrate the task. As outlined in [IBM: What Is Few-Shot Learning?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/few-shot-learning/), few-shot learning is often applied to classification tasks and can be combined with semi-supervised methods to leverage unlabeled data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, a prompt might include a few input-output pairs, such as \"Question: What is the capital of France? Answer: Paris,\" followed by a new question for the model to answer. This approach, as detailed in [NeurIPS: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Abstract.html), was demonstrated with GPT-3, showing strong performance on tasks like translation and question answering without fine-tuning. The advantage is a reduction in the need for task-specific data, making it scalable and cost-effective, though it may struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning without additional support.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Enhancing Reasoning\n",
        "\n",
        "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by encouraging them to generate intermediate reasoning steps before providing a final answer. This method, as explored in [NeurIPS: Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/9d5609613524ecf4f15af0f7b31abca4-Abstract-Conference.html), involves including instructions like \"Let's think step by step\" or providing examples with step-by-step reasoning in the prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, for a math word problem, the prompt might show how to break down the problem into smaller calculations, such as identifying the given numbers, performing intermediate operations, and then arriving at the final answer. [Learn Prompting: Chain-of-Thought Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intermediate/chain_of_thought) highlights that CoT is particularly beneficial for complex tasks like arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, with empirical gains being significant. For example, prompting a 540B-parameter model with eight CoT exemplars achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K math benchmark, surpassing fine-tuned models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The effectiveness of CoT prompting lies in its alignment with human reasoning processes, breaking down multi-step problems into manageable parts. Variants like zero-shot CoT, which adds \"Let's think step by step\" without examples, and automatic CoT, which generates reasoning chains, further enhance its applicability, as noted in [Prompt Engineering Guide: Chain-of-Thought Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Comparative Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "To illustrate the differences between these techniques, consider the following table, which summarizes their characteristics based on the discussed sources:\n",
        "\n",
        "| **Technique**         | **Description**                                      | **Examples Needed** | **Best For**                          | **Limitations**                          |\n",
        "|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n",
        "| Zero-Shot Learning    | Performs tasks without examples, using pre-training | None                | Simple tasks, broad knowledge        | Struggles with specific, complex tasks   |\n",
        "| Few-Shot Learning     | Adapts with a few examples                          | 1-5 examples        | Tasks with limited data, quick adaptation | May need more examples for complex reasoning |\n",
        "| Chain-of-Thought      | Encourages step-by-step reasoning                   | Examples with steps | Complex reasoning, math, logic        | Less effective with smaller models       |\n",
        "\n",
        "This table underscores the versatility of prompt engineering, allowing LLMs to handle a spectrum of tasks from basic classification to advanced problem-solving, depending on the technique applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Practical Implications and Future Directions\n",
        "\n",
        "The ability of LLMs to perform zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought tasks has significant implications for various fields, including natural language processing, education, and industry. For instance, zero-shot learning can reduce the need for labeled data in new applications, while few-shot learning can accelerate deployment in data-scarce environments. Chain-of-thought prompting, meanwhile, opens avenues for solving complex problems, potentially transforming areas like automated tutoring or decision support systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future research, as suggested in [Medium: Mastering Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning in LLMs](https://medium.com/%40anicomanesh/mastering-few-shot-and-zero-shot-learning-in-llms-a-deep-dive-into-cross-domain-generalization-b33f779f5259), may focus on optimizing these techniques for smaller models, improving robustness to prompt variations, and addressing ethical concerns like data privacy, especially given the reliance on large web corpora.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, LLMs and prompt engineering represent a dynamic field with ongoing advancements. Understanding these techniques not only enhances their practical use but also highlights the potential for AI to augment human capabilities across diverse domains.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Overview\n",
        "Ollama Phi-4-mini is a model you can run locally using the Ollama platform, known for its strong reasoning, especially in math and logic, and enhanced multilingual support. It also supports function calling, which lets it interact with external tools. Using Python, you can interact with this model through the Ollama Python library to craft effective prompts and get the responses you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Getting Started\n",
        "First, ensure you have Ollama installed (version 0.5.13 or later for Phi-4-mini) and pull the model using the command `ollama pull phi4-mini`. Then, install the Ollama Python library with `pip install ollama`. This lets you use Phi-4-mini in your Python scripts for tasks like translation, reasoning, or problem-solving.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Prompt Engineering Techniques\n",
        "Here are some tips to guide Phi-4-mini effectively:\n",
        "- **Be Clear**: Ask specific questions, like “Translate ‘Hello’ to French.”\n",
        "- **Use Examples**: For few-shot learning, give a couple of examples, e.g., “English: Hello, French: Bonjour.”\n",
        "- **Think Step-by-Step**: For complex tasks, say “Let’s think step by step” to help with reasoning, like solving math problems.\n",
        "- **Set Roles**: Tell the model to act as something, like “You are a math tutor.”\n",
        "- **Use Delimiters**: Mark sections with symbols like `>>>>>` for structured outputs, especially for code or lists.\n",
        "- **Control Outputs**: Set `temperature=0` in the library for consistent answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Python Example\n",

        "\n",
        "This section provides a comprehensive analysis of prompt engineering guidelines for the Ollama Phi-4-mini model, using the Ollama Python library for implementation. The discussion is informed by recent research and practical examples, aiming to offer a detailed understanding for those interested in both the theoretical and practical aspects of interacting with this specific large language model (LLM).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Understanding Ollama Phi-4-mini\n",
        "\n",
        "Ollama Phi-4-mini is a lightweight open model developed by Microsoft, available through the Ollama platform, which facilitates running LLMs locally. According to [Ollama Phi-4-mini](https://ollama.com/library/phi4-mini), Phi-4-mini brings significant enhancements in multilingual support, reasoning, and mathematics, and now supports function calling, a feature that allows the model to interact with external tools or APIs. It requires Ollama version 0.5.13 or later and supports a 128K token context length, making it suitable for tasks requiring long context understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model underwent an enhancement process, incorporating supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, ensuring precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures. It is intended for broad multilingual commercial and research use, with a focus on general-purpose AI systems and applications requiring strong reasoning, especially in math and logic, as noted in [Microsoft Phi-4 Models Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educatordeveloperblog/welcome-to-the-new-phi-4-models---microsoft-phi-4-mini--phi-4-multimodal/4386037).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The Role of Prompt Engineering with Phi-4-mini\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts to guide LLMs in generating desired outputs. For Phi-4-mini, this is crucial given its capabilities in reasoning and multilingual tasks, and its support for function calling adds a layer of complexity and opportunity. Using the Ollama Python library, developers can integrate Phi-4-mini into Python projects, leveraging its features through simple API calls, as detailed in [Ollama Python Library](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python).\n",
        "\n",
        "The process involves trial and error, creativity, and an understanding of the model's strengths, such as its reasoning abilities and multilingual support. Research suggests that effective prompt engineering enhances the safety and performance of LLMs, enabling new capabilities like augmenting models with domain knowledge and external tools, as highlighted in [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Guidelines for Prompt Engineering with Phi-4-mini\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on various resources, the following guidelines are essential for effective prompt engineering with Phi-4-mini, implemented through the Ollama Python library:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understand the Task**: Clearly define the task to ensure the prompt is specific and unambiguous. For example, instead of asking “Tell me about history,” specify “Summarize the history of the Roman Empire in 100 words.” This aligns with best practices from [DigitalOcean Prompt Engineering](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/prompt-engineering-best-practices-tips-tricks-and-tools).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Use Zero-Shot or Few-Shot Learning**:\n",
        "   - Zero-shot learning involves asking the model to perform a task without examples, relying on its pre-training. It’s effective for general requests, as seen in [Hugging Face Zero-Shot](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/zero_shot_classification). For Phi-4-mini, this can be implemented by sending a simple message, e.g., `chat(model='phi4-mini', messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Translate \"Hello\" to French'}])`.\n",
        "   - Few-shot learning provides a few input-output pairs to guide the model, reducing the need for extensive labeled data. This is particularly useful for tasks like classification, as discussed in [IBM Few-Shot Learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/few-shot-learning). For example, include examples in the messages list, as shown in the Python example below.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Incorporate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: For reasoning-intensive tasks, encourage step-by-step thinking by including phrases like “Let’s think step by step” or providing examples with intermediate reasoning. This improves accuracy on complex tasks like arithmetic, as shown in [NeurIPS CoT Prompting](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2022/file/9d5609613524cf4f15af0f7b14577632-Paper.pdf). For Phi-4-mini, you might prompt: `messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let’s think step by step: Solve 2x + 3 = 7\"}]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Define Roles**: Assign a specific role to the model, such as “You are a Python developer” or “You are a helpful assistant,” to set the context and improve output quality. This technique, known as role prompting, is detailed in [Learn Prompting CoT](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/chain_of_thought). In Python, set this in the system message, e.g., `messages=[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a math tutor'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Solve 2x + 3 = 7'}]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use Delimiters and Structured Formats**: Use markers like `>>>>>` and `<<<<<` to separate input and output sections, especially for tasks requiring specific formats like JSON or lists. This helps the model understand the structure, as seen in [Google Prompt Engineering](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification/step-3). For example, `messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': '>>>>> Input: Solve 2x + 3 = 7 <<<<< Output in JSON format'}]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Control Output Variability**: When using the Ollama Python library, adjust parameters like `temperature` (e.g., set to 0 for deterministic outputs) and `max_tokens` to manage response length and consistency. This is crucial for applications requiring predictable outputs, as noted in [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create). For Phi-4-mini, you can do this by adding parameters to the `chat` function, e.g., `chat(model='phi4-mini', messages=messages, temperature=0)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Iterate and Test**: Prompt engineering often involves trial and error. Test different phrasings, adjust based on results, and refine prompts iteratively. This is emphasized in [Medium Prompt Engineering](https://medium.com/@fareedkhan/prompt-engineering-complete-guide-7b7e8f8c9d2c), where iterative development is key for optimizing LLM outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Leverage Function Calling**: Given Phi-4-mini’s support for function calling, design prompts that allow the model to suggest or call external functions. This can be particularly useful for tasks requiring interaction with tools or APIs. The Ollama Python library version 0.4 supports this, as seen in [Ollama Blog Functions](https://ollama.com/blog/functions-as-tools), where you can define Python functions and pass them to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Comparative Analysis of Techniques\n",
